## A Local Community Gifting Group

### Helping Those in Need

<p>
By helping those in need with Freebie gifts, we can do a lot to help the environment. Gifts that would have been sitting in a landfill taking up space will instead help the people that need them the most.
</p>
<p>
Freebie helps to foster a sense of inclusion and engagement through local community gifting and winning.

### Circular Economy Changes
<p>
Right now, our economy is heavily based on consumption alone. This overconsumption of goods and materials causes so much harm to the environment. We should strive for a circular economy; one in which everyone reuses and recycles items whenever possible. This way, everyone will be doing their part to help save the planet. Freebie aims to create a more sustainable economy and encourages change for the better.

### Here at Freebie

<p>
we value our members, just like we value our communities.

We can’t live without either, so we need to take care of them as much as we possibly can. Freebie provides a platform where you can post your donations, so you don’t have to worry about them adding to the cycle of pollution. The next time you are getting rid of belongings you no longer use, post it on Freebie, and gift to your community in need.
